# Project Overview

## 2024: Salt Concentration Detector
This project focuses on detecting the salt concentration in water by measuring changes in electrical conductivity. An Arduino is used to measure voltage changes in a water sample and perform real-time calculations to determine salt concentration.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a rudimentary version of the code used in the actual competition. This is designed to give you a foundation for the event, not complete the project for you :P

# Features:
- Measurement of salt concentration using voltage and conductivity principles
- Real-time data collection and processing using Arduino
- Algorithmic conversion of voltage to concentration readings

# Project Goals
- Apply fundamental electronics and computer science skills to build functional devices.
- Combine hardware design and software programming to solve real-world measurement challenges.
- Demonstrate the use of mathematical and physical principles in creating detectors for practical applications.

# Files Included:
salt_concentration_detector.ino: Arduino code for measuring voltage and calculating salt concentration.
README.md: This file with project descriptions and details.

# How to Run the Code:
- Download the .ino file
- Open the file in the Arduino IDE.
- Connect your Arduino to your computer and upload the code.
- Follow the wiring instructions provided in the source code comments to set up the electronics
- Run the system and observe the output in the Serial Monitor or LCD display.
- (NOTE: not every wiring path is commented, part of the challenge is figuring out what the code means and how to implement certain parts)

# Requirements:
- Arduino board (Uno, Mega, etc.)
- Basic electronic components (resistors, capacitors, wires, etc.)
